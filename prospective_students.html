Our group is well funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.</li>

                            <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion for mathematics.

                            <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, networking, and scholarship opportunities.
