Our group is well funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.</li>
                            <li>The primary avenue for us to recruit PhD stduents is through <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">UT ECE</b> (DICE Track).

Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss your research interest and experiences. We are usually not very interested in your GPA and standard test scores.</li>
                            <li>Postdocs, and self-funded visitors are welcome to apply, and will be evaluated case by case. We are always open to working with UT undergraduates and master students for projects. Please contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a> and specify your interest (we prefer if you can share more than pure "interest").</li>

Our research interests constantly evolve, and we always stay open to be intellectually excited and inspired by new things.</li>
                            <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion for mathematics. Our research heavily leverages matrix analysis, optimization, and statistical learning.</li>

Every student works directly and closely with Dr. Wang. The group also benefits a lot from its highly interactive, intimate, and helpful culture.</li>
                            <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, networking, and scholarship opportunities. You can check from current group members' rich experiences. </li>
                            <li>Our students are highly popular among top employers, for both internship and full-time opportunities.
