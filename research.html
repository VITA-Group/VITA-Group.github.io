                     <p>At VITA group, we have <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">unusually broad, and forever-evolving</b> research interests spanning from the <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">theory</b>  to the <b style="color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">application</b> aspects of machine learning (ML). Our current "research keywords" include, but are not limited to:  sparsity (from classical optimization to modern neural networks); efficient training, inference or transfer (especially, of large language models); neural scaling law; robustness and trustworthiness; learning to optimize (L2O); generative AI; graph learning, and more. Below, we describe a few organized themes that are driving our group's latest efforts.</p>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>Theme 1: Efficient and Scalable Learning through Intrinsic Low Dimensionality</h4>
                        <p>

                        One of the most fundamental reasons for the existence and emergence of intelligence is that the world is not fully random, but highly structured and predictable. Hence, a fundamental purpose and function of intelligence or science is to learn parsimonious models (or laws) for such predicable structures, from massive sensed data of the world. The traditional approach to algorithm design, based around parametric models for specific structures of signals and measurements – say sparse and low-rank models – and the associated optimization toolkit, is now significantly enriched with data-driven learning-based techniques. Nevertheless, the successes of both modern data-driven and classic model-based paradigms rely crucially on correctly identifying the low-dimensional structures present in real-world data, to the extent that we see the roles of "learning" and "compression" of data processing algorithms – whether explicit or implicit, as with deep networks – as inextricably linked.  Most recently, the advent of foundation models (LLMs) has led some to posit that parsimony and compression itself are a fundamental part of the learning objective of an intelligent system, connecting to ideas from neuroscience on compression as a guiding principle for the brain representing the sensory data of the world. </p>

                        <p>In our group, the pursuit of learning with low-dimensional models or representations occupies a central place. For example, we have contributed many well-recognized works to laying theoretical foundations for sparse neural networks’ efficiency, optimization, and generalization; and to demonstrating their empirical promise, from TinyML to large foundation model (e.g. LLM) applications. We also created a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02596">short handbook for sparse NN researchers</a>.

                        <h4>Theme 2: Generative AI for 2D/3D Visual Synthesis and Editing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our group's earlier (pre-2021) work includes several influential algorithms for image enhancement and editing “in the wild,” many of which are based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We pioneered a few innovative GAN architectural designs (TransGAN, DeblurGAN-v2, EnlightenGAN, AutoGAN) that are now widely adopted by the community. More recently (post-2021), we have steered our focus to two new areas: (i) 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF); (2) the new generation of multi-modality GenAI, leveraging the latest workhorse of diffusion models (text2image, text2video, text-to-3D, etc.)

                        <h4>Theme 3: Learning to Optimize (L2O) </h4>
                        <p>
                            L2O is an emerging paradigm that leverages ML to automatically develop an optimization algorithm. It demonstrates many practical benefits including faster convergence and better solution quality. Over the past five years, we have spearheaded an ever-growing line of L2O works that significantly expand both rigorous theories (L2O convergence, worst-case/average-case generalization, adaptation, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability), and practical adoption (inverse problems in computational sensing/imaging, large model training, private training, protein docking, AI for finance, among others). Please refer to the <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0308/21-0308.pdf">L2O Primer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VITA-Group/Open-L2O">Open L2O toolbox</a> that we presented for this community.

                        <h4>Theme 4: New Architectures and Model Scaling </h4>
                        <p>
                           We are devoted to studying emerging model families that promise to become future “universal” workhorses or "foundational models": two such examples are transformers (especially LLMs) and graph neural networks, and many projects here are owing to our close collaboration with industry leaders. We are meanwhile enthusiastic about AutoML & neural scaling law, on both consolidating its theoretical underpinnings ("why choosing this model, not that one?") and broadening its practical applicability ("what more can be automated, and how to do it better?"). State-of-the-art ML systems consist of complex pipelines with multiplied design choices. We see AutoML as a central hub in addressing those design challenges; it also proves to be a powerful tool for understanding many ad-hoc choices of network architectures or hyperparameters (often aided by the deep learning theory).

                        <p>
                            As ML systems (in particular, computer vision and LLM) are influencing all facets of our daily life, it is now commonplace to see evidence on the untrustworthiness or harmful impacts of ML systems in high-stake environments. We have strived to build ML algorithms that are resilient to various environment degradations, perturbations, adversarial attacks, and privacy threats - as overviewed in our  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3551385">ML Safety Primer</a>. We are also keen on developing AI4sicnece (protein, medical image, material science), and AI for the Common Good (our <a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/projects/being-watched-embedding-ethics-in-public-cameras">Good Systems</a> project)
